Anonymized data of all school assignment requests made on behalf of
CPS students with IEPs requiring placement from
{previous_quarter_start} to {previous_quarter_end}. These records
should include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the
date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request
was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the
date the student enrolled.

Because this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit
The FOIA Bakery’s work to advocate for public education, please waive
any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS § 140/6(c). Feel free to contact me
with any questions, or if clarification is needed.
